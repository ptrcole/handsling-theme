Carbon track bikes are lighter, stiffer and more aerodynamic. Start on sensible ratios, then evolve the cockpit and wheels. You’ll keep the same race-proven frame that’s delivered 90+ elite victories, with an upgrade path as your speed grows.<\/p>"}},"item_JmiVbg":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"Are carbon track bikes faster than aluminium or steel on indoor velodromes?","content":"<p>Typically, yes. Carbon lets us design more aerodynamic frame profiles and a lay-up that has better stiffness-to-weight, meaning fewer watts lost to flex and drag. On track that translates to higher speeds, and easier maintenance of that speed during hard efforts.<\/p>"}},"item_YWqkfz":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"What’s the difference between a track bike and a fixed gear bike for the road?","content":"<p>A track bike is a purpose-built racing bicycle for velodrome cycling: fixed gear, no brakes, tight geometry and UCI-compliant dimensions. A road “fixed gear bike” often adds brakes, has more room for bigger road tyres, and a more relaxed geometry.<\/p>"}},"item_6P39XQ":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"What crank length is best for sprint vs endurance on track cycling bikes?","content":"<p>Though it is down to personal preference, we recommend 165mm cranks with all of our track frames.<\/p>"}},"item_akNnWL":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"Do you offer fittings in the UK before I order my track bike?","content":"<p>Yes. You can book a fitting\/consultation at our Hampshire facility. We’ll review your measurements or existing fit, discuss your target events, gearing and wheel choices, and finalise a custom specification so your track bike arrives ready for your local velodrome. To arrange a visit, contact <strong>sales@handslingbikes.com<\/strong> or call <strong>01420 612700.<\/strong><\/p>"}},"item_UMRBmU":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"What lead times should I expect for a custom-built track bike?","content":"<p>A Handsling custom track bike is ready in around 4-6 weeks, depending on paint and component choices. Once your order  is confirmed, we’ll book your paint slot, and once the frame has completed painting, we then assemble and quality check your bike in the UK. We will always keep you updated from order to handover.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["item_MJykJi","item_yn3AJz","item_JmiVbg","item_YWqkfz","item_6P39XQ","item_akNnWL","item_UMRBmU"],"name":"FAQ","settings":{"full_width":true,"subheading":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","content":"<p>Learn about Handsling bikes and what separates us from the competition.
