The A1R0evo offers a more versatile platform – perfect for short course, draft-legal triathlons or riders who want comfort and agility alongside aero performance.

All three are carbon-fibre race machines assembled in Britain.<\/p>"}},"item_MteWMJ":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"What are the key advantages of a carbon triathlon bike for long-distance races?","content":"<p>A carbon triathlon bike delivers the best balance of speed, comfort, and efficiency for long-distance events. Carbon fibre’s vibration-damping qualities reduce fatigue over hours in the saddle, while its stiffness ensures every watt goes into forward motion. Lightweight construction aids climbing, and aerodynamic tube shaping cuts drag – helping you maintain a faster, steadier pace throughout Ironman-length races.<\/p>"}},"item_A69Pj7":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"Is there a difference between a road bike and a triathlon bike?","content":"<p>Yes. A triathlon bike refers to dedicated long course bikes that feature steeper seat-tube angles, shorter head tubes, and integrated aero tribars to place the rider in a more aerodynamic position. This design reduces frontal area and conserves energy for the run. A road bike is used for short course triathlons, in which you can draft other riders, and prioritises all-round handling and comfort, making it ideal for group rides and races. Handsling’s A1R0evo platform is ideal here, being aerodynamic yet versatile for short course triathlon events.<\/p>"}},"item_z9qtAf":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"What makes a carbon triathlon bike faster than other alternatives?","content":"<p>Carbon fibre triathlon bikes are faster because the material allows precise aerodynamic shaping without extra weight. The result is a frame that slices through the air, remains stiff and responsive under power, and is light and agile on the climbs. Compared to aluminium or steel, carbon absorbs vibration more effectively, improving control and comfort so athletes can maintain aero position longer – a key factor in overall speed and endurance.<\/p>"}},"item_LBPUiT":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"How do I choose the right triathlon bike for my race distance?","content":"<p>Short-course and draft-legal athletes often prefer an agile, aero-road-based triathlon bike like the A1R0evo for responsive handling in a closely packed bunch of athletes. For long-course or Ironman racing, the TSTRevo offers better aerodynamics and greater stability for sustained high-speed efforts. Consider factors such as fit, position, terrain, and comfort – Handsling’s Remote Tailored Sizing ensures your triathlon bike is optimised for your distance and riding style.<\/p>"}},"item_WQ7WMh":{"type":"item","settings":{"title":"Are Handsling triathlon bikes available to test ride in the UK?","content":"<p>Yes.
